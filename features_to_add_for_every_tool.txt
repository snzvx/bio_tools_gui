"advanced nested scrolling system"
I notice you have a scrollable_canvas.py file in the gui/ directory. This is exactly what we need for the advanced nested scrolling system.

use "main application's scrollbar"

Content appears in scrollable_canvas.scrollable_frame (your tools_parent).

The output Frame :
output to be shown in a "unified display area" , No section dividers .


--------------------------
Tool Integration: The ToolAreaManager places tools in a tool_wrapper frame using a pack_environment frame

Scrolling: It uses a scrollable_canvas object

Tool Parameters: Tools need to accept the parent frame and be integrated via pack() .
